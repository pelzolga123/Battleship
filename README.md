## About The Project

The [battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) project is the

have a full grasp of javascript concepts like Object Oriented Programming, Objects, Constructors, Factory
Functions, The Module Pattern, ES6 Notation, Webpack and Testing with Jest. The
game was built in ES6 using test driven development with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
